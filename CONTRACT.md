# HydraDB client contract

Every shipped HydraDB client wraps the generated SDK (`hydradb-sdk` / `@hydradb/sdk`) behind a thin,
hand-owned layer and exposes the **same vocabulary** for the **same operations**. This document is
the authority for both. If a client's surface disagrees with this file, the client is wrong.

Why this exists: the SDK's method names are generated from OpenAPI **summary text** with no
`x-fern-sdk-method-name` overrides, and its CI auto-bumps only the patch digit while publishing on
merge — so a breaking rename can arrive as `2.1.2 → 2.1.3`. The wrapper is the firewall that keeps
that churn from reaching users. It is the reason we pin the SDK **exactly**, never with `^`/`~`/`>=`.

## 0. Client groups

The four clients are organised into **two groups**. A client belongs to exactly one.

| Group | Clients | What they are |
|---|---|---|
| **Group 1** | `hydradb-claude-code` (Claude Code plugin) · `openclaw-hydradb` (OpenClaw plugin) | **Agent plugins.** They extend a host agent that is already running. HydraDB is reached through skills, slash commands and agent tools; the end user never invokes them directly. |
| **Group 2** | `hydradb-cli` · `hydradb-mcp` | **Direct clients.** A person or a program drives them on purpose — a terminal command, or an MCP server a host connects to. Their surface is the product. |

Groups are the unit of coordination. A change that alters a shared surface is landed
across **every client in the group together**, so the two clients in a group never
disagree in a release. Concretely:

- **Group 1** shares the plugin idiom: slash-command names, skill front-matter, and the
  `--json` state shapes marketplace-shipped skill files parse. A rename in one is a rename
  in both.
- **Group 2** shares the *invocation* surface: command and tool names, flag and parameter
  spelling, and the `--output json` / `structuredContent` shapes that `jq` and MCP hosts
  parse. When both clients expose the same capability they expose it the same way — the
  same verbs, the same scope flags, the same defaults.

This does **not** relax anything below. §1's vocabulary, §2's wrapper rules and §3's alias
policy bind every client in both groups. Groups say who moves together, not who is exempt.

Where a capability exists in only one group, that is a deliberate product decision and is
recorded as such, not treated as drift for the other group to catch up on.

## 1. Canonical vocabulary

### Nouns

| Canonical | Meaning | Never say |
|---|---|---|
| **database** | isolated tenancy container | tenant, namespace, workspace (as a scope), knowledge base |
| **collection** | partition within a database | sub-tenant, sub_tenant_id |
| **context** | the stored-unit family (memory + knowledge) | — |
| **memory** | a context item of kind `memory` | user memory, preference |
| **knowledge** | a context item of kind `knowledge` | document, file, source-as-kind |
| **unified** | the one kind of a database created with `type: "unified"` (PRO-1618); the only kind such a database accepts, and its default. Clients read the layout from `GET /databases` `details[]` and default to it there | — |
| **source** | one ingested item; its identifier field is `id` | source_id, file_id, doc_id |
| **chunk** | one retrieved fragment of a source | — |

`context` names **one** thing: the stored-unit family. Its two other historical senses are
expressed as compounds, never as a bare `context`:
- the string you inject into a prompt → **context string**
- the knowledge graph → **context graph**

`workspace` is not a HydraDB term. It may refer only to a client's *local* notion (the plugin's
project directory) and must never denote a database, collection, or org.

### Verbs — exactly one per action

| Canonical | Absorbs |
|---|---|
| **query** | search, recall, full_recall, recall_preferences, boolean_recall, full, preferences, keyword, retrieve |
| **ingest** | add, store, remember, save, capture, upload, sync (local file sync), push, index |
| **list** | list_data, browse, "fetch sources" |
| **inspect** | fetch content, get content, fetch_content |
| **delete** | remove, forget |
| **relations** | graph_relations, graph_relations_by_id |
| **subgraph** | source_subgraph, connected subgraph, thread (as a graph read) — Group 2 only |

### The `status` disambiguation (mandatory)

`status` currently names four unrelated things. Two are poll-until-ready calls; picking the wrong
one silently polls the wrong subject. Clients MUST use these names instead:

| Concept | Canonical name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| per-source indexing progress | **ingestionStatus** / `ingestion-status` | is this source indexed yet |
| database infra provisioning | **readiness** / `readiness` | is the database ready for ingestion |
| local client health | **doctor** | config present + endpoint reachable |

### Environment variables — canonical prefix `HYDRADB_`

| Canonical | Deprecated aliases still read (with a one-line warning) |
|---|---|
| `HYDRADB_API_KEY` | `HYDRA_DB_API_KEY`, `HYDRA_OPENCLAW_API_KEY` |
| `HYDRADB_DATABASE` | `HYDRADB_TENANT_ID`, `HYDRA_DB_TENANT_ID`, `HYDRA_OPENCLAW_TENANT_ID` |
| `HYDRADB_COLLECTION` | `HYDRADB_SUB_TENANT_ID`, `HYDRA_DB_SUB_TENANT_ID` |
| `HYDRADB_BASE_URL` | `HYDRA_DB_BASE_URL`, `HYDRADB_API_URL` |

A deprecated alias is honoured but emits exactly one stderr warning per process naming the canonical
replacement. The canonical name wins if both are set.

**Per-client scoping (important):** a client reads the canonical `HYDRADB_*` name plus **only the
legacy prefix(es) it itself historically shipped** — not every spelling in the table. Concretely:
the Claude Code plugin, MCP, and CLI read the `HYDRA_DB_*` spellings (and the plugin's existing
`HYDRADB_*`); OpenClaw reads `HYDRA_OPENCLAW_*`. No client reads another client's prefix — e.g. the
plugin must NOT read `HYDRA_OPENCLAW_API_KEY`. The table above is the union across clients, not a
per-client checklist.

---

## 2. The wrapper surface

Each client exposes a `HydraDB` wrapper object. Method names are canonical (§1); each maps to the
current SDK method internally. Language casing: `snake_case` in Python, `camelCase` in TS/JS.

| Wrapper method | SDK call today | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `databases.create(database, …)` | `databases.create(database=…)` | — |
| `databases.delete(database)` | `databases.delete(database=…)` | — |
| `databases.list()` | `databases.list()` | returns ids only |
| `databases.collections(database)` | `databases.collections(database=…)` | was "list sub-tenants" |
| `databases.stats(database)` | `databases.stats(database=…)` | row counts |
| `databases.readiness(database)` | `databases.status(database=…)` | **renamed away from `status`** |
| `context.ingest(database, kind, …)` | `context.ingest(…)` | multipart; `kind` ∈ {memory, knowledge} |
| `context.query(database, query, kind?, …)` | `client.query(…)` | the single retrieval entry point |
| `context.list(database, kind?, …)` | `context.list(…)` | — |
| `context.inspect(database, id, …)` | `context.inspect(…)` | was "fetch content" |
| `context.ingestionStatus(database, ids)` | `context.status(…)` | **renamed away from `status`** |
| `context.relations(database, id?, …)` | `context.relations(…)` | — |
| `context.subgraph(database, id, depth?, maxSources?)` | *(none — raw `GET /context/{id}/subgraph`)* | connected subgraph; **no SDK resource yet** |
| `context.delete(database, ids, kind)` | `context.delete(…)` | one path for memory + knowledge |
| `graph.query(database, collection, query, params?)` | *(none — raw `POST /byog/query`)* | BYOG Cypher; **no SDK resource at 2.1.2** |
| `graph.createDatabase(database)` | *(none — raw `POST /byog/databases`)* | — |
| `graph.collections(database)` | *(none — raw `GET /byog/collections`)* | — |
| `graph.dropCollection(database, collection)` | *(none — raw `DELETE /byog/collections`)* | idempotent |
| `graph.dropDatabase(database)` | *(none — raw `DELETE /byog/databases`)* | `deleted:false` ⇒ collections only |

Rules every wrapper obeys:

1. **Exact SDK pin.** Depend on `hydradb-sdk==<x.y.z>` / `"@hydradb/sdk": "<x.y.z>"` — never a range.
2. **Unwrap the envelope, but not blindly.** Most methods return `HandlerEnvelope{data,success,meta}`;
   return `.data`. But `connectors.*` mostly returns bare objects and
   `databases.updateMetadataSchema` is not enveloped — unwrap by checking for the envelope shape,
   never by assuming it.
3. **Own env/config.** Both SDKs read zero environment variables; the wrapper supplies `token`,
   `base_url`, database, collection from config per §1.
4. **Translate errors** back into the host client's existing error type/shape. Do not let raw SDK
   exception types leak to surfaces that previously saw the client's own error. An error's
   **message** and its **path** are part of that shape — see *Errors are interface* below.
5. **Preserve host behaviour** the SDK does not provide (redaction, silent-failure, retries capped
   under hook budgets, defaults, output shapes). These are listed per-client in the plan.
6. **Send `API-Version: 2`.** (The SDK does this; a client that previously sent no version header is
   changing server behaviour by adopting it — that is intended, but must be tested, not assumed.)
7. **A hand-rolled path is still the wrapper.** Some endpoints have no SDK resource — BYOG
   (`/byog/*`) has none at `2.1.2`. Those are called directly, but from *inside* the wrapper and
   behind the same surface: same envelope-by-shape unwrapping, same `API-Version: 2` header, same
   translated error type. A caller must not be able to tell which methods went through the SDK.
   When the SDK grows the resource, only that one file changes. This does not weaken rule 1 — an
   endpoint the SDK does not expose has no generated name to be insulated from.

### Errors are interface, not diagnostics

An agent tool propagates a failed call, so an error's **message** reaches the model, and a client
that recovers from a failure branches on its **path**. Both are interface. Changing either is a
client-visible change that needs a test — never a copy edit, on the server side or the client side.

Two things about this are counter-intuitive, and both cost us a round when we met them:

- **An error code is not automatically the discriminator.** `CORPUS_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED` covers six
  refusals that point in different directions: two mean "retry as unified", four mean the caller
  must change something else, and retrying one of those four pins a split database to the wrong
  corpus for the life of the process. The code narrows to the family; the **message** decides which
  member. So the message text is load-bearing precisely *because* the code is not sufficient.
- **A value that varies per request cannot be matched on.** A GET carries its scope in the query
  string, so the request URL differs every call. The **operation path** (`/context/relations`) and
  the request URL must stay separate: the transport sends the URL, the error reports the operation
  path. Otherwise anything branching on `path` silently stops working for those calls only — and
  the varying URL leaks database, collection and item ids to the model as a bonus.

Four instances so far. Each is now held by a test rather than by convention, on both sides of the
wire where a server string is involved:

| The string | Held by |
|---|---|
| The layout-refusal wording (six messages, two directions) | server `TestCorpusRefusalWordingIsAClientContract`; client tables over the same six verbatim |
| The layout-aware `all`-on-ingest advice, which puts "This database is unified" inside a refusal that must **not** be retried | the same client tables — siblings are excluded *before* the code is read |
| The error prefix (`Hydra <path> → …`, not the MCP wrapper's `Hydra DB …`) | client test pinning both raw branches |
| The error path (operation path, never the request URL) | client test asserting the stable path and that the wire call still sends the real scope |

## 3. User-facing names + alias policy

Adopt the canonical user-facing name on every surface, and keep every current name working as a
**deprecated alias that emits one warning**. Aliases are removed only in a later major, after
telemetry shows adoption. These surfaces make aliases mandatory (renaming them outright is breaking):
MCP tool names live in users' `mcp.json`; the plugin's `--json` shape is parsed by marketplace-shipped
skill files and persisted to `state.json`; the CLI's `--output json` is a documented `jq` contract.

## 4. Conformance

Each repo ships a runner that feeds `conformance/vectors.json` (identical across repos) through its
wrapper and asserts the canonical call it produces. This is the anti-drift gate: a client that
renames an action, changes a default, or diverges in ingest behaviour fails its own CI. See
`conformance/README.md` in each repo.
